# What & Why?

## What is it

> - An R wrapper for the beloved JavaScript Highcharts library

> - Pretty and versatile: bars, maps, bubbles, heatmaps, density, timeseries, and so on

> - Interactive: many plots in one

> - syntactically similar to ggplot2

## Why you'll like it

>  - Same reasons: pretty, versatile, interactive, not even hard.

>    - Interactive plots *save you time*.
>   + <h6>No more labeling bar heights</h6>
>   + <h6>Include context without clutter via hover box</h6>
>   + <h6>No more plotting every combination of comparison groups (simply click to show/hide groups)</h6>
>   + <h6>Allow for x and y zooms (especially useful for timeseries) </h6>


> - People will respect you



> -  *You get to use R*

<h2>We cannot let the python bros win.  </h2>


## But seriously... 

> - highcharter *makes R look good*.  **Dress your data to impress.**

> - We *all* benefit when you make R look good. 
>   + <h6> Your company will keep hiring R users (they don't see the code, they see the output)</h6>
>   + <h6>More people will want to learn R</h6>

> - People expect fancy viz now.
>   + <h6>The world is digital (don't make print plots for digital viewing)</h6>
>   + <h6>Gamification, leader boards, etc. raised viz expectations for non-tech people</h6>

> - You can justify R in a sea of Python users
>   + <h6>You can use my line: "R is for research, Python is for production."</h6>

> - Again, we cannot let the python bros win.
>     + <h6>If we lose the viz battle I'm becoming an interior decorator.</h6>
